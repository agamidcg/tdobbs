# print("Hello, world!")

#Exercise 1: Calculation

# bread = 2.41
# eggs = 5.28
# milk = 2.56 

# total_cost = bread + eggs + milk
# print(f"Your total is ${total_cost} Thank you!")

# Exercise 2: String Manipulation

# this line takes the user input for the store name
# store = input("Please enter store name: ")
# # This prints a welcome message using user input as store name
# print(f"Welcome to {store}!")

#Exercise 3: Common Errors

# milk = "3"
# bread = 2.5
# total = milk + bread
# print("The total cost is: $" + total
 # removed the quotes from the 3 you can't use strings in Math problems
# milk = 3
# bread = 2.5
# total = milk + bread
# #used an f-string to print the total cost
# print(f"The total cost is: $",total)
